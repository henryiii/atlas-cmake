In this episodes, we hope to introduce the organization of the ATLAS software (athena).

# What is Athena?
All of the central ATLAS software is stored in a public repository called [Athena](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/athena). it contains all of the code used for simulation, data reconstruction, triggering, calibration and object identification.

This lesson will not touch any of this source code in detail. How to develop new Athena software is covered in the [official ATLAS documentation](https://atlassoftwaredocs.web.cern.ch/athena/). Instead we will focus on *using* a pre-compile versionof a few athena package.
