This lesson builds on the `AnalysisPayload` program developed in the ATALS GitLab lesson. To continue, you will need to have a working version of it.

If you had any issues working on your own project, you can always clone a working copy from the [usatlas-computing-bootcamp/v4-gitmodule-submodule-jetselector-simplecmake](https://gitlab.cern.ch/usatlas-computing-bootcamp/v4-gitmodule-submodule-jetselector-simplecmake) GitLab repository.
